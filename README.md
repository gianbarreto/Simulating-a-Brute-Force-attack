# Simulating-a-Brute-Force-attack

This is a project made via **hackthebox.com** called “Brutus”, more specifically a project simulating a blue team scenario.

**Briefly introduction to the scenario:**

After gaining access to the server, the attacker performed additional activities, which we can track using auth.log. Although auth.log is primarily used for bruteforce analysis, we will delve into the full potential of this artifact in our investigation, including aspects of privilege escalation, persistence, and even some visibility into command execution.
